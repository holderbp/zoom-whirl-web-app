that accompanies the manuscript:

"Understanding exotic black hole orbits using effective potentials"
Steven Pakiela, Brett Bolen, Ben Holder, Monica Rizzo, Shane L. Larson
https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04072

Running the python code (plot-output-data.py) in the same directory
with the data (csv) files will produce a pretty pdf of the effective
potential, orbit, and gravitational wave signal.  The same plot can be
produced directly from the app using the "export plot" button.
