- Show value of eccentricity and apoapsis under the orbit

- fix the "Controls": remove reset button, make a pause, ff/rew, and 2x 1/2x buttons

- Make grab-able shapes for the energy and the angular momentum, for fast changing of their values

- Fit the window size better (currently dashboard doesn't fit on my laptop screen, need to scroll down)
